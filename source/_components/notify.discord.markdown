The [Discord service](https://discordapp.com/) is a platform for the notify component. This allows components to send messages to the user using Discord.

In order to get a token you need to go to the [Discord My Apps page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and create a new application. Once the application is ready, create a bot user. Retreive the client ID and the (hidden) token of your bot for later.

When setting up the application you can use this [icon](https://home-assistant.io/demo/favicon-192x192.png).

### {% linkable_title  Configuration %}

To use Discord notifications, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
notify:
  - name: NOTIFIER_NAME
    platform: discord
    token: A1aB2b.C3cD4d-E5eF6f
```

Configuration variables:

- **name** (*Optional*): Setting the optional parameter `name` allows multiple notifiers to be created. The default value is `notify`. The notifier will bind to the service `notify.NOTIFIER_NAME`.
- **token** (*Required*): Your bot's token.

### {% linkable_title  Using the bot %}
Bots can only send messages to servers. To add the bot to a server you are an admin on, use the Discord OAuth2 Authorization page: 

[https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1234567890&scope=bot&permissions=0](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1234567890&scope=bot&permissions=0)

Replace the client ID with the appropriate one from the [Discord My Apps page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).

Once the bot user has been added to your server, get the channel ID of the channel you want the bot to operate in.
* In The Discord app go to Settings > Appearance > Check developer mode
* Right click channel name > Copy ID

This channel ID has to be used as the target when calling the notification service. Multiple channel IDs can be specified, across multiple servers.

#### {% linkable_title Example service payload %}

```json
{
  "message": "A message from Home Assistant",
  "target": [
    "1234567890",
    "0987654321"
  ]
}
```
